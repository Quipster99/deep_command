## Game Mechanics

### Base Building

#### Excavation System
- **Grid-based digging**: 32x32 pixel tiles on each layer
- **Material types**: Soft earth, rock, reinforced stone (visual only, affects excavation time)
- **Excavation costs**: Time and worker allocation, scales with depth
- **Aesthetic elements**: Support beams and ventilation are purely decorative, automatically placed as part of room construction
- **Progressive Depth**: Deeper layers unlock through research/progression and cost more to excavate

#### Room Types

**Essential Infrastructure**
- **Command Center**: Mission planning and base overview
- **Power Generator**: Provides energy for all systems
- **Life Support**: Maintains atmosphere and temperature
- **Quarters**: Housing for personnel (capacity based on size)
- **Cafeteria**: Morale and efficiency boost
- **Elevator**: Vertical access to adjacent layers, stackable to create shafts through multiple layers

**Operational Rooms**
- **Portal Chamber**: The gateway for away missions
- **Briefing Room**: Mission selection and team assignment
- **Armory**: Equipment storage and loadout management
- **Medical Bay**: Healing and hero recovery
- **Training Room**: Skill improvement for heroes

**Research Facilities**
- **Laboratory**: Basic research on artifacts
- **Advanced Lab**: Unlocked tech for complex projects
- **Containment**: Secure storage for dangerous items
- **Engineering Bay**: Reverse-engineering alien tech
- **Greenhouse**: Study of alien flora

**Security Systems**
- **Security Office**: Monitor threats and intrusions
- **Armory**: Defensive equipment and weapons
- **Holding Cells**: Contain threats or specimens
- **Automated Defenses**: Turrets and barriers

#### Building Rules
- Rooms require minimum dimensions (varies by type)
- Adjacent rooms provide efficiency bonuses
- All rooms can be built on any layer (player's choice)
- Power and life support must reach all rooms
- Elevators must be vertically aligned to form continuous shafts
- Multiple elevator shafts can be placed anywhere for redundancy and access optimization
- No structural integrity concerns - purely spatial planning

#### Elevator System
The elevator is the primary vertical transportation mechanism, allowing personnel and equipment to move between layers.

**Placement Rules**:
- Can be placed on any excavated tile on any layer
- Acts as a 1-tile or multi-tile structure (exact size TBD)
- To access the layer below, an elevator must be placed directly beneath an existing elevator
- Creates a continuous vertical shaft when stacked through multiple layers

**Strategic Considerations**:
- **Multiple Shafts**: Players can build several independent elevator systems
- **Access Control**: Strategically place elevators to control traffic flow
- **Redundancy**: Multiple shafts provide backup if one becomes compromised
- **Distance Optimization**: Place elevators near high-traffic areas on each layer
- **Security Layers**: Omit elevators on certain layers to create isolated zones
- **Expansion Planning**: Leave space for future elevator placement

**Functional Behavior**:
- Personnel automatically use nearest elevator when pathfinding between layers
- Elevator capacity may limit simultaneous users (design TBD)
- Travel time between layers creates realistic delays
- Elevators require power to function
- Malfunctioning elevators trap personnel until repaired

**Visual Design**:
- Clearly visible shaft connecting aligned elevators
- Animated platform movement
- Status indicators (operational, damaged, unpowered)
- Queue visualization when capacity-limited
